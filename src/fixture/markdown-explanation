README

This README is automatically added to documentation generated by Doc-Buddy. The
files in this directory are generated in Markdown format, aside from this file.

Markdown may be read as text files, but is best consumed via a Markdown reader,
which will render the conventions of Markdown into HTML.

This developer uses the Chrome extension "Markdown Preview Plus" with the
"GitHubLeft" theme.  This extension can be downloaded at:

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl?hl=en-US

There are some permissions that need to be granted to make it work, follow the
instructions.  Alternatively, there are dedicated readers that can be used to
read Markdown, or one can commit generated docs to a codebase and view them via
GitHub, GitLab, or whichever source control website you use.

With a Markdown reader in hand, navigate to the index.md file, or locally, simply
drag that file into Chrome.  You'll know it is working if hyperlinks are working.


Cheers,

Scott
